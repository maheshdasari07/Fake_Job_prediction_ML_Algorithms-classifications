# Fake_Job_prediction_ML_Algorithms-classifications
To avoid fraudulent post for job in the internet, an automated tool using machine learning based classification techniques is proposed in the paper. Different classifiers are used for checking fraudulent post in the web and the results of those classifiers are compared for identifying the best employment scam detection model. 
PROPOSED SYSTEM
 The target of this study is to detect whether a job post is fraudulent or not. Identifying and eliminating these fake job advertisements will help the job seekers to concentrate on legitimate job posts only. In this context, a dataset from Kaggle is employed that provides information regarding a job that may or may not be suspicious.

A.Implementation of Classifiers
 In this framework classifiers are trained using appropriate parameters. For maximizing the performance of these models, default parameters may not be sufficient enough. Adjustment of these parameters enhances the reliability of this model which may be regarded as the optimised one for identifying as well as isolating the fake job posts from the job seekers.

B.Performance Evaluation Metrics 
While evaluating performance skill of a model, it is necessary to employ some metrics to justify the evaluation. For this purpose, following metrics are taken into consideration in order to identify the best relevant problem-solving approach. Accuracy is a metric that identifies the ratio of true predictions over the total number of instances considered. However, the accuracy may not be enough metric for evaluating modelâ€˜s performance since it does not consider wrong predicted cases. If a fake post is treated as a true one, it creates a significant problem. Hence, it is necessary to consider false positive and false negative cases that compensate to misclassification. For measuring this compensation, precision and recall is quite necessary to be considered.

CONCLUSIONS 
Employment scam detection will guide job-seekers to get only legitimate offers from companies. For tackling employment scam detection, several machine learning algorithms are proposed as countermeasures in this paper. Supervised mechanism is used to exemplify the use of several classifiers for employment scam detection. Experimental results indicate that Random Forest classifier outperforms over its peer classification tool. The proposed approach achieved accuracy 98.27% which is much higher than the existing methods.
